# Doubly-Linked-List

A project for the USF CS221 class (Fall '21)

This is a doubly linked list program that implements Insert, Member, Delete, and Free_list methods, stores a list of strings, and stores the strings in increasing alphabet order.

A doubly linked list minimizes the use of memory for the list. So the individual nodes in the list only store as many characters as are actually in the string

It also minimizes search times by exploiting the alphabetical ordering of the list. So the Insert, Member, and Delete methods only search through the list as far as needed.
